# Audit changes
We decided to incorporate all changes listed in our peer audit. These changes included color contrast not meeting the minimal requirement and lack of semantic label for our canvas. Because the voiceover cannot determine what the user has actully inputted into the canvas, the semantic label is not descriptive in providing details on content. We label it as a drawing canvas and described its usage as an alternative. For our views, we changed the color scheme to meet the requirements of WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum. These changes ensure that accessibility is persistant throughout our app. Users of all abilities are now able to fully engage with our app and utilize all our features. Without these changes, users with imapired vision or those who rely on voiceover would have otherwise had a more difficult time navigating Flutterlingo. The other requirement we needed to meet was WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content, which we did so by adding additional Semantics to the canvas to better instruct the user.
