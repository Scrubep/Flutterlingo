# Addressing a human need
Many online articles opionate that apps lack customization and may not effectively address the needs for new language learners or for students with spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. 

# Critique of an existing app
In the case of new language learners, many apps such as Duolingo do not provide customized words for users to learn. They have premade lessons that might not be relevant for the needs of the user. If a user is planning to travel overseas and needs to learn helpful phrases for everyday use, such as how to ask directional questions, they will not get that opportunity unless Duolingo has that lesson and the user has progressd enough to unlock them. However, with Flutterlingo, users can customize the phrase they want to learn and practive how to spell and in turn likely read and say those phrases. 

# Existing Evidence
For students with spelling difficulties like dyslexia, "memories for whole words are formed much faster and recalled much more easily when children have a sense of language structure and receive ample practice writing the words" (Internation Dyslexia Association). With daily use of Flutterlingo, because you are able to practice your phrases multiple times, this improves students' ability to recall language structure through repetitive exposure and in turn improves their language abilities. From the IDA, "A few irregular words should be practiced daily (e.g., come, they, their, who). Tracing and saying the letters, building the words with letter tiles, copying and writing in sentences, all help build memories for irregular words." Flutterlingo's canvas allows for this practice with its features and students can copy and write the phrase they want to learn so they can learn how to spell.
